# Audiothingies DoubleDrummer

There are three separate definitions here, one for "Parameter" mode, one for
"Mixer" mode, and one for manipulating samples in "Dual" mode. The Parameter
and Mixer definitions are the full spec for either of those two (mutually
exclusive) modes.

You can use Parameter and Dual/Sample definitions at the same time on separate
tracks, sending Parameter mode CCs on channel n and sample-related CCs on
channel n+1.
